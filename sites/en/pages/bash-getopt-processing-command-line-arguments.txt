=abstract start

In this example we have a function that can optionally! accept the following parameters:

=abstract end

<code>
-v
-d
--debug
--name VALUE
</code>


The call to <gl>getopt</hl> defines the accepted names.
The <hl>-o dv</hl> defines that we accept two short switches <hl>-v</hl> and <hl>-d</hl>.
The <hl>--long debug</hl> defines that we accept the <hl>--debug</hl> switch.
The <hl>--long name:</hl> defines that we accept the <hl>--name</hl> option followed by some value.

Then we have a whole <hl>while</hl> loop to actually take out the values from the list on the comand line
and to assign the appropriate values to variables.
Either 1 to the variables representing the switches, or the actual value passed to the <hl>--name</hl> option.

At the end we need to call this function with the <hl>args $0 "$@"</hl> expression.

<h2>An example calling it</h2>

<code>
$ ./cli.sh --name "Foo Bar" --debug -v

Foo Bar
1
1
</code>

<code>
$ ./cli.sh --wrong

getopt: unrecognized option '--wrong'
Incorrect option provided
</code>


<h2>If condition in bash</h2>

I used to have this, in the above code:

<code>
[ $? -eq 0 ] || {
    echo "Incorrect option provided"
    exit 1
}
</code>

This is I think the shell-style meaning:

"Either the previous command is successful (exit 0)  or `||` do the block (echo and exit)".

Later I realized using `if` would make it much more readable so I changed it to:

<code>
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Incorrect option provided"
    exit 1
fi
</code>

They both do the same.
