Normally a Node.js script stops running when it reaches the end of the script and when there are no more event handlers waiting for events.
What if you want the script to stop earlier?

=abstract end

It's quite easy.

The built-on <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/process.html">process</a> module has a method
called <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_exit_code">exit</a>:

<include file="examples/node/process_exit.js">
