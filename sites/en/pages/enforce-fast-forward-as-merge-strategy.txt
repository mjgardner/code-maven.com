=abstract start

Some people like to see lots of branches and the way they are merged together in their git history. Others like to have nice straight line.

Some companies have a development workflow in which the only way to add to the "master" branch is to send a pull-request, get it reviewed, approved and then merged into "master". For them it might be useful to enforce that merging into master can be done only with a fast-forward merge.

=abstract end

There are several ways to enforce it or at least to gently nudge you in the chosen direction.

<code>
git config --global merge.ff only
</code>

That will add an entry to your <hl>~/.gitconfig</hl> file:

<code>
[merge]
    ff = only
</code>

and it will require that you only merge branches that can fast-forward. That basically forces you to either rebase before merging, or turn off this configuration, or to force your way through using

<code>
git merge --no-ff
</code>

Alternatively you can execute the following command <b>while inside a git workspace</b>

<code>
git config --local merge.ff only
</code>

This will add the same entry to the <hl>.git/config</hl> of the current project.
This way the enforcing only happens in specific projects.

Of course all this is on the client side and not on the server.

<h2>Enforce fast-forward to a single branch only</h2>

Adding the following to the <hl>.git/config</hl> file of your project will enforce the "merge only with fast-forward" rule on the "master" branch only.

<code>
[branch "master"]
    mergeOptions = --ff-only
</code>

This is also describe by <a href="https://twitter.com/mvuksano">Marko Vuksanovic</a>

<h2>Team Foundation Server</h2>

TFS allows the admins to set 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/repos/git/branch-policies?view=vst">branch policies</a>. Among the several features one can <b>Enforce a merge strategy</b>, but as far as I can see only <b>No fast-forward merge</b> and <b>Squash merge</b> are available.


<h2>Atlassian BitBucket</h2>

The documentation seems to indicated that the admin of a project can set the
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/pull-request-merge-strategies-844499235.html">available merge strategies</a>, but all I managed to do was to set the default merge strategy. It indeed stopped me from accepting a pull-request that could not be merged using fast-forward. However I was still able to pick a different merge strategy when I was about to accept the pull-request.

Maybe I have not looked close enough.

<h2>GitHub</h2>

As far as I know GitHub does not support requiring fast-forward when you accept and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/">merge a pull-request</a>.

<h2>GitLab</h2>

As I can see one can set <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/fast_forward_merge.html">fast forward merge</a> as the only acceptable merge strategy.


<h2>Comments</h2>

On Bitbucket Server you can install my "Control Freak" plugin to enforce a fast-forward policy when merging into certain branches (e.g., master).
