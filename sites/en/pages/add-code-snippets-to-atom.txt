Snippets are a great feature of any editor or IDE and in <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
they are quite simple to use.

<h2>How to use a snippet in Atom</h2>

In a file you start typing the "prefix" of an existing snippet.
Atom will show you a list of snippets that match the text you started to write.
If you stop typing you can select one of the entries using the up and down arrow.

When you press TAB or ENTER, Atom will insert the code snippet in the place where you started
to type.

There are many snippets that come with Atom pre-installed and you can easily create
your own snippets as well.

<h2>Add your own snippet to Atom</h2>

You own snippets need to be defined in the <hl>snippets.cson</hl> file which is located
in your home directory. For me it was in the <hl>~/.atom/</hl> directory, though I don't
even have to know that, if I open the "Atom" menu, it has an entry to <hl>Open Your Snippets</hl>
that will open the <hl>snippets.cson</hl> in your favorite editor.

<img src="/img/atom_snippet_editor.png" alt="Atom menu to open snippet editor" />

In that file you need to add an entry like this


<code>
'.text.html':
  'HTML 5':
    'prefix': 'html'
    'body': '''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes">
        <title></title>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/3.0.3/handlebars.min.js"></script>
        <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
    </html>
'''
</code>

This will work for html files.

The first string describes the 'scope' of where this will work.

Each file-type has a scope and each file extension is mapped to a scope.
Specifically the scope of the HTML files is <hl>text.html.basic</hl>
and the following extensions are considered HTML files:
<hl>htm, html, kit, shtml, tmpl, tpl, xhtml</hl>

I know this because I opened the <hl>Settings</hl> (Actually the <hl>Atom / Preferences</hl> menu option)
and among the <hl>Packages</hl> looked for the one handling HTML files. This is how it looks like:

<h2>Comments</h2>

Exactly what I was looking for to bet a long ad code snippet working. Thanks..

<hr>

How can i stop auto-complete to mess with my snippets? When i tab, it does code completation instead of my snippet! Is it possible to do bind it in another key?

Thank you! This was helpful. Do you know of a community site where snippet examples and shared? Maybe a github repo?
