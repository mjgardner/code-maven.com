This posts is here only to collect some of the notes I have about Datadog. With time it might become a more comprehensive post.

<h2>Setup</h2>

Create an account and install the agent on one of your servers. It will immediately start sending generic system-related metrics.
eg. cPU load, memory usage, disk IO, Network etc. It will also start sending metrics about itself.



<h2>Datadog command line tools</h2>

It is written in Python so you install it with the following command:

<code>
pip install datadog
</code>

Get the API  key and Application key from your <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings">account settings</a>.
You can then save them in ~/.dogrc but when you run <hl>dog</hl> on the command line it will ask for the values and save them
in the config file for you.

<code>
[Connection]
apikey = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
appkey = BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
</code>

<h2>Submit an event from the command line</h2>

<code>
dog event post "Command line title" "command line text"
</code>

Then see it on your <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/event/stream">event stream</a>.

<h3>Post some metric</h3>

<code>
dog metric post foobar.test 1
dog metric post foobar.test 2
</code>
